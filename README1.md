# Data analysis and machine learning on type 2 diabetes for pregnant women dataset
You'll get the detailed code from the libraries used to cleaning to visualizing to doing data analysis and multiple machine learning models to choose the optimal one for this projects

## Understanding the project and files within repository:

The main machine learning file for this project is 'Assessment_Riad.ipynb' where you'll find the pre-processing, visualizations, and multiple machine learning models that I've test, and the detailed conclusion and solutions to recover from diabetes.

## Deployment of this project in web App

To deploy this project I've created a new separate version of the code which is shorter where I used the KNN ML model, you'll find it in the file called 'Diabetes_deployment_ML.ipynb'. That file has a predictive model, and a saved version of the ML model used, the purpose was to create a web app that could have inputs from the project and also use the KNN model as a model for future predictions. 

## Tools used:

- Jupyter notebooks
- Spyder IDE
- Anaconda terminal (streamlit for visualizing the web app)
